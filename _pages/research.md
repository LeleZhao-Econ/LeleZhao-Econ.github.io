**Education As Insurance: Property Division and Women's Education.** (Job Market Paper)

<div class="paper-abstract">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Wealth distribution upon divorce, such as property division, shapes incentives by altering the marital surplus of women and men. In 2011, China’s marriage law shifted from equal-sharing to deed-based property division, disproportionately reducing women’s wealth upon divorce, as 87% of titles were in men’s names. Facing greater economic insecurity, women may use education as insurance against future losses. This paper examines how the reform affected young women’s educational choices. I first develop a two-period model predicting that a decline in marital surplus increases women’s educational investment. I then implement a continuous difference-in-differences design, using the 2010 male-only deed share as a measure of policy intensity. Consistent with the model, I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in male-only deed share led to a 3.5 percentage point rise in four-year college enrollment among women aged 18–22. Relative to provinces with a gender-balanced distribution of deeds, the reform increased women’s enrollment by 12.1 percentage points overall. These findings suggest that shifts in the marriage market influence women’s human capital investment as insurance, and that property division reforms can unintentionally accelerate higher education, contributing to the rapid rise in women’s educational attainment in contemporary China.

**The Impact of Straw Burning Ban on Children's Health in China.**

<div class="paper-abstract">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> I examine the impact of agricultural fires—a major source of air pollution in rural areas globally—on children’s health. I leverage the Crop Straw Resource Utilization (CSRU) pilot policy, which offers subsidies to reduce straw burning and promote alternative uses of crop residue. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that the policy led to a 39% reduction in straw fire counts in subsidized provinces. This decline in agricultural fires leads to a 5.6% improvement in the Air Quality Index (AQI) and a 7.4% decrease in PM2.5 concentration one year after the policy was implemented. However, these improvements in ambient air quality do not persist beyond the first year. Corresponding to the short-term improvement in air quality, I find a 14.3% decrease in the likelihood of hospital visits among children, but only for those from households engaged in agricultural activities. No significant changes are observed in the incidence of asthma or other respiratory illnesses. Notably, the likelihood of households using straw as a cooking fuel increases by 22.2%, suggesting that the health benefits of improved outdoor air quality may be offset by rising indoor air pollution. This shift highlights a trade-off between two competing mechanisms: while income effects from the subsidies may help reduce healthcare utilization, the increased reliance on straw as an indoor fuel may counteract those health gains by exposing children to higher levels of indoor pollutants. The net effect appears muted, and the evidence for an income-driven decline in hospital visits remains suggestive.

**The Impact of Telemedicine on Physicians' Offline Behavior and Patient Health Outcomes: Evidence from China.**  
with Yu Liu, Lu Yao

<div class="paper-abstract">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> China's telemedicine industry had neared a mature stage before the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 466 million people using online medical services. The domestic coronavirus outbreak further spurred its rapid expansion and deepened the integration of online and offline healthcare systems. This transformative trend has been continuing in the post-pandemic period. However, the causal effects of physicians' participation in telemedicine on their offline behaviors and patients' health outcomes remain largely unexamined. This study combines comprehensive transaction data from Haodf.com, one of China's famous online healthcare platforms, with inpatient claims data from a large public hospital from 2019 to 2022 to answer this question. We exploit variations in online adoption rates across physician specialties before the pandemic. We examine how this exogenous shock influenced physicians' online and offline behaviors using a dosage difference-in-differences approach. Then, we assess how these behavioral changes impact patients' health outcomes. Preliminary exploration suggests three major findings. First, physicians in specialties with higher telemedicine adoption rates experienced more online visits than those with lower adoption rates after the pandemic. Second, the increase in physicians' online labor supply does not reduce their in-hospital labor supply, as they use fragmented time during work hours and after hours to respond to online patients' inquiries. Third, the overall increase in labor supply does not affect the length of stay, readmission, or mortality among inpatients, suggesting that telemedicine does not come at the expense of patients' health outcomes. More research is needed to explore the full range of outcomes associated with telemedicine.

**Does Retirement Improve Health? The Assessment of Retirement on Hospital Readmission in China.**  
with Yu Liu, Lu Yao

<div class="paper-abstract">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite decades of discussion on the impacts of retirement, our understanding of how retirement affects health outcomes remains limited. In China, statutory retirement ages for formal workers are strictly implemented. Hence, it provides a perfect natural experiment to examine the causal impact of retirement behavior on health outcomes. This study utilizes inpatient claims data in a large hospital in China and employs a regression discontinuity design to examine the impact of retirement on inpatient utilization, costs, and health outcomes across different groups of people – males, blue-collar females, and white-collar females – whose statutory retirement ages differ in China. While the compliance of retirement status with statutory retirement age is very high for all three groups, our findings show that retirement does not significantly increase people's inpatient visits. Similarly, the cost of hospitalization does not change significantly after retirement. However, we observed a substantial increase in the probability of hospital readmission among white-collar females. This result remains robust even after accounting for health insurance and pension differences. Our results have important policy implications for gender and occupational differences in statutory retirement ages.
